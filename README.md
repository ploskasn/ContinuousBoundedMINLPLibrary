# ContinuousBoundedMINLPLibrary
This repository includes the continuous bound-constrained problems from MINLPLib library from the paper entitled "Improving derivative-free optimization algorithms through an adaptive sampling procedure". The problems are coded in C. Each executable requires an "input.txt" file with the values of the variables and returns the output of the objective function in the "output.txt" file.

These files can be used to test and compare black-box optimization algorithms.

The "statistics.csv" file includes the name of each problem, the number of variables, and the optimal objective value.
